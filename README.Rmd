The goal of `hydrofab` is to provide consistent hydrologic and hydraulic network manipulation tool chains to achieve model application ready datasets from a consistent reference fabric. Some of these are being built at [ngen.hydrofab](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/ngen.hydrofab) and [gfv2.0](https://code.usgs.gov/wma/nhgf/gfv2.0)


## Installation

You can install the development version of hydrofab like so:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mikejohnson51/hydrofab")
```


## Introduction 

This package is based around the same concepts as [nhdplusTools](https://usgs-r.github.io/nhdplusTools/) in an attempt to provide a common software stack for fabricating hydrofabrics.

### Refactoring and Aggregating

The concept of refactoring as intended here includes:

1) **Splitting** large or long catchments to create a more uniform catchment size
distribution,  
2) **collapsing** catchment topology to eliminate small catchments


The concept of aggregating as intended here includes **aggregating** catchments into groups based on existing network topology and defined criteria. Two primary use cases are offered:

1. Aggregating to a set of defined outlet locations
2. Merging catchments to a uniform size with enforced minimum areas and lengths.

This type of functionality is especially relevant to modeling applications that
need specific modeling unit characteristics but wish to preserve the network as
much as possible for interoperability with other applications 


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics(c("man/figures/lynker-logo.png","man/figures/noaa-logo.png", 'man/figures/usgs-logo.png'))
# library(cowplot)
# xx = ggdraw() +
#   draw_image("man/figures/usgs-logo.png", width = 0.33,   height = .25, y = .05) +
#   draw_image("man/figures/noaa-logo.png", width = 0.33,   height = .35, x = 0.33) +
#   draw_image("man/figures/lynker-logo.png", width = 0.33, height = .25, x = .66, y = .05) 
# 
# cowplot::save_plot(xx, filename = "man/figures/logos.png")
``` 

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/logos.png")
```
